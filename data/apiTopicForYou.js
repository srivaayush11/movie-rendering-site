What begins as a path to healing becomes a harrowing descent where memory fractures, time distorts, and reality bends. A first-of-its-kind cinematic experience, Soul to Squeeze begins in a boxy 4:3 aspect ratio and ever so slowly widens to a full 2.35:1 by the final frame-mirroring Jacob's expanding perception as he risks everything for redemption. Visually daring and emotionally raw, Soul to Squeeze merges body with mind, taking audiences on a perilous journey through the psyche.",

When uploaded the video goes viral, so they start a challenge: if the video reaches a certain number of views, they will enter the house again, at night, alone, totally unprotected.
